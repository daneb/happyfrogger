## Docker: How to Setup MSSQL

1. Mac OS has emulation for non-ARM docker images with [Rosetta 2](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/apple-silicon/about-rosetta-2)
2. This is particularly useful for MSSQL on MacOS,
as I had initially reverted to using  Azure SQL Edge (arm supported).
3. There is a performance hit with Rosetta 2 on Mac, but I think it's not too much.
4. Top tip, for seeding the DB with actual test data,
add the copy within the Dockerfile allowing the user
to specify file location manually so the backup or restore file not stored in git.
5. The easiest restore process is fire up the container, and run a restore from 
Azure Data Studio or SQL Server Management Studio.

```sql
RESTORE DATABASE [YourDatabaseName] FROM DISK = '/var/opt/mssql/backup/file.bak' 
WITH MOVE 'YourDataFile' TO '/var/opt/mssql/data/YourDataFile.mdf', 
     MOVE 'YourLogFile' TO '/var/opt/mssql/data/YourLogFile.ldf';
```

6. If you need to determine the name of DataFile and LogFile, use the following:

### Jump into your MSSQL container

```sql
docker exec -it temp-sql /opt/mssql-tools/bin/sqlcmd -S localhost -U SA -P "yourStrong(!)Password"
```

### Get the DataFile and LogFile name

```sql
RESTORE FILELISTONLY FROM DISK = '/var/opt/mssql/backup/file.bak';
GO
```

## LazyNvim

### Find words or strings quickly

- Find words quickly in a file: s + <string> + <autogenerated_letter>
Eg. s Get j
- This will search for letters "Get" in the file, and go to the location "j" as generated by LazyNvim (or Leap plugin).

### Go back or forward on buffer history
- [ b : to go back
- ] f : to go forward

### Find your Keymaps

- <space> sk : shows all keymaps

### Pull up Warnings

- <space> xx: Show warings and errors
