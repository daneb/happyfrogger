## LLMs

If you want to get started with an LLM locally, for privacy concerns or exploration
give [LM Studio](http://lmstudio.ai) a shot.
In selecting the right LLM for you requirements check out [this list of LLMs](https://huggingface.co/models?pipeline_tag=text-generation) 
or [What LLM to use](https://github.com/continuedev/what-llm-to-use).
The beauty of LM Studio is that you can easily maintain your LLMs, 
but also interact with them via the common OpenAI API protocol. 

## How to setup your own LazyNvim Plugin

I wrote a blog post on my building of a LazyVim plugin 
that integrated with LM Studio.
