# UML Diagrams from Typescript

I was recently putting together [C4 Model diagrams](https://c4model.com/) and when I got to the last-level, I needed code level-views.
This is where I stumbled onto the following automation to assist with TypeScript to UML.
Automatic generation of UML from typrscript.

# Git, EditorConfig and Darn Windows Users

If you in a team and the only Linux/Mac user and using Git. This is the setting you need for you git config.
```
core.autocrlf=false
````

# Git access multiple accounts

Adapt this and add to your ~/.ssh/config 

```yaml
# Enterprise account
Host github.com-enterprise
  HostName github.com
  User git
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa_github_enterprise
  IdentitiesOnly yes

# Personal account
Host github.com-personal
  HostName github.com
  User git
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa_github_personal
  IdentitiesOnly yes
```

Make sure for each repo you set the following to match:

```sh 
git config user.name "Your Enterprise Username"
git config user.email "your_enterprise_email@example.com"
```

Then define your remote origin:

```
git remote set-url origin git@github.com-enterprise:Organization/repo.git
```

# High Fidelity Tests
This is an absolutely well articulated blog post on Testing. 
It emphasizes to pursue high fidelity tests. That is tests, that are closest to reality.
It suggested a three-fold approach, of starting with (1) use the real thing (2) use a fake, and worst-case (3) use a mock.

I find this salient advice, tying directly to my experience.
