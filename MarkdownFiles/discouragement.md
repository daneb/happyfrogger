The road of life \
ah yes the road of life

At some turn along life, \
there THEY comes with their assault of strife \
with winds that rage and winds that blow, \
they beat, make meat of the courageous feat. \
To live is hard. Is it?

The weapons of these diabolical demons, \
are seldom understood or even from my hood. \
They beckon me come and surrender the fight. \
They beckon me come and surrender the night.

What of hopes and dreams and joy and streams, \
What of health and wealth, \
when it's all abated. \
They come with his assault of strife, \
attacking and sucking me into the darkness.

I fight, I kick, I whip, I punch, \
I raise my hand, but I get pulled in a bunch. \
They are strong, far stronger than me, \
They deep in my mind causing calamity. \
Turn back turn back the light onto me, \
Turn back turn back its uncomfortable inadequacy.

FIGHT! FIGHT! I say. I say. \
But the warmth of day is gone \
All around me has diminished, chaos around. Chaos. \
Hope what of it, I know it intellectually. \
But she is hidden. Where I don't know?

How did it get all so complex. \
How did THEY get so strong. \
 Who are THEY and why do me wrong. \
My legs are deep in the myrrh now, DEEP. \
Darkness is upon me, and I can't intellectualize myself away

A crack from the heavens \
A fizzle? a ray? a sparkle? a way. \
Some spirit illuminates \
"My grace is sufficient for thee: for my strength is made perfect in weakness."
HUH.

What did it mean? \
I began to tussle with the words of the spirit, \
I wrestle, turn, twist and contort, \
hammering against 14 challengers a new, \
looking for answers for this light so few.

And little did I notice, \
that as I wrestled with the 14 challengers that day, \
my contention with THEY went away, \
darkness still loomed in the distance, \
but the battle was over, for now.

I recited the words of the spirit, \
and then it hit me like a ton of bricks succinctly, \
That it was never about MY OWN *strength\*\* to overcome \
But I was already equipped with *grace sufficient\* to step out the darkness \
Despite my inherent weakness.

They will be back soon, one day, \
and in my weakness to these words I shall cling.
