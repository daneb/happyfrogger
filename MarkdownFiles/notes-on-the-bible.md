# Understanding the Bible's Timeline and Books

## Overview
The Bible contains 66 books written over about 1,500 years. While these books appear in a certain order in our Bibles, they weren't written in that same order. Understanding when they were written helps us better understand their message and context.

## New Testament Timeline
The New Testament books were written between 45-96 AD. Surprisingly, James was actually the first book written (around 45 AD), not Matthew! The last book written was Revelation (around 95-96 AD).

## Old Testament Timeline
While Genesis is the first book in our Bibles, Job was likely written first during the time of Abraham. After Job, Moses wrote Genesis and the other four books of the Law (Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy).

# Focus on Jude

## Quick Facts
- Written: Around 67-68 AD
- Author: Jude, one of Jesus' brothers
- Audience: Christians facing false teachers
- Length: Just 25 verses - one chapter!

## Who Was Jude?
Jude was Jesus' half-brother (they shared the same mother, Mary). Interestingly, he doesn't introduce himself as "Jesus' brother" but as "a servant of Jesus Christ." This shows his humility and recognition that Jesus was more than just his family member - He was his Lord and Savior!

## Main Message
Jude's main message is simple but powerful: "Stand firm for true Christian teaching." He warns believers about false teachers who had secretly entered the church and were twisting God's grace into an excuse for immoral behavior.

## Key Points to Remember
1. Christians need to actively "contend" (struggle, fight) for true faith
2. False teachers had infiltrated the church, misusing God's grace
3. Jude uses Old Testament examples to warn about God's judgment on rebellion
4. He gives practical advice for staying strong in faith
5. Contains unique information about spiritual warfare (like Michael the archangel's dispute over Moses' body)

## Why It Matters Today
While written nearly 2,000 years ago, Jude's message is still relevant. Christians today still need to:
- Know what they believe and why
- Be able to recognize false teaching
- Stand firm for truth while showing love
- Remember God's faithfulness in the past
