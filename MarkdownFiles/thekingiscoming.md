# The King is Coming

Up in the sky, the tempests rage,\
as the heaven's proclaim the coming age,\
where Jesus the Lamb, breaks vials of his own,\
as he pours out their tears all over his throne.\
His fury and wrath ascends to the highest,\
and shall descend to the deepest, where the darkest liest.

Down on the earth, in the land of men,\
The people dance and sing in their wicked den,\
Praising self, rejecting Him, denouncing the Cross\
Living their best life at great cost.\
They live to enjoy each new day,\
And steep themselves in comforts of rich array.

High up in heaven, the Lord mounts His horse,\
and prepares to descend and evil divorce,\
His Word like a sword proceeds from His mouth,\
As He commands his armies to gather out.\
Down to the earth they go,\
The righteous will avail with mighty bow.

In Sodom and Gomorrah, they see the signs,\
The earth is groaning but they remain benign.\
Flashes scatter across they sky,\
As the Lord breaks open every wretched lie.\
The fire and fury of His descendance unknown,\
As He comes to grant vengence to His very own.

Be-warned, be wary, murmur not and complain,\
For Jesus is coming, coming again,\
To rule and to reign,\
To scatter the rain,\
To dry up our tears,\
And wrestle all fears,\
Jesus, Jesus the King,\
Is coming again.
