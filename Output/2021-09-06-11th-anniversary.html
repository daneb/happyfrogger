<p><strong>To my darling wife...</strong></p>
<p>Raging waters raging tide,<br />
Magic wonder water ride.<br />
Up and down the wild rapids flow,<br />
Never held back by the perennial snow.</p>
<p>Rising up, rising high,<br />
Five Adventurers sailing nigh,<br />
Challenged by the waves of time,<br />
Never short of corny rhyme.</p>
<p>Of the Adventurers to sail the day,<br />
never hindered come what may,<br />
Quick at hand, the eldest child,<br />
engineering master, soft and mild.</p>
<p>Zip, zany and bubbly bee,<br />
baking, straining and fruitfully retaining.<br />
Happy, pee-pee pelican,<br />
tackles the shores with his magical red wheels of tin.</p>
<p>Of we go the crazy bunch,<br />
11 years of chocolate munch.<br />
Hand in hand, off they sail,<br />
The head a genius handsome male.</p>
<p>By his side, a dashing dame,<br />
Whose bum curves the wild winds tame,<br />
Ever moulding, ever bold,<br />
Always together with the tightest hold.</p>
<p>Friends forever the heads they are,<br />
Adventurers greatest we are by far.<br />
Thankful to the Lord each day,<br />
That Five Adventurers in beauty array.</p>
