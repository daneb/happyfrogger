<h2>Low-level mechanics:</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>Apply active listening</strong> - redirect from listening to the thoughts inside your own head to that of your team mate.  Examples:
<ol>
<li>Paraphrasing</li>
<li>Building trust</li>
<li>Non-verbal cues such as nodding, eye contact, leaning forward</li>
<li>Open-ended questions</li>
<li>Asking specific question to see clarification</li>
<li>Asking open-ended questions</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>Record and track</strong> - listen, make notes and track
<ol>
<li>Trello - I like to have a shared board where we can track items, highlight concerns and record wins</li>
<li>On the fly - in daily interactions when there's a win, concern or something to follow up on, add it to the board</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>Introspection and no deflection</strong>
<ol>
<li>Ask the hard questions to get your team member to think about their actions, behaviour and growth. Often times, engineers optimize for delivery rather than introspection.</li>
<li>Don't hold back on hard conversations or truth. Deal with things early and deal with them well.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>Their time not yours</strong>
<ol>
<li>Show up on time</li>
<li>Allow them to cancel and not you. But if there's nothing to talk about, cancel.</li>
<li>Let them speak, not you</li>
<li>Avoid status updates.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Have a <strong>clear agenda</strong> focused on:
<ol>
<li>Results</li>
<li>Career growth</li>
<li>Feedback</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>Make it actionable</strong>. Take outcomes, conversations and discussions into actions.</li>
<li>Listen or probe for <strong>tension, friction or personal concerns</strong> in their lives.
<ol>
<li>This creates a lens by which they operate</li>
<li>Perhaps even making ill-informed decisions</li>
<li>Or just having a different perspective for which impacts their motivation and drive</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>Don't solve their problems</strong>
<ol>
<li>You are not a clinical psychologist</li>
<li>Be very mindful about the advice you give</li>
<li>Collaborate to action, clarify to enable</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Tools to encourage interaction:</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>ABC - The foundation of growth</strong>
<ul>
<li>You can use this diagram to generate conversation</li>
<li>Let the team member lead by completing the information</li>
<li>Revisit after analysis, time and reflection</li>
<li>Track</li>
<li>Build an action plan
<img src="/images/one-on-one.png" alt="ABC" /></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Introspective questions</strong>
<ol>
<li>Whatâ€™s on your mind this week?</li>
<li>How happy were you this past week?</li>
<li>How productive were you this past week?</li>
<li>What feedback do you have for me?</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>Team-related questions</strong>
<ol>
<li>What do you think of the teams morale?</li>
<li>How is your relationship with X?</li>
<li>Where do you think we could improve in our delivery?</li>
<li>How did you deal with a specific situation in which you were criticized by a senior?</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>Performance-related questions</strong>
<ol>
<li>What are some achievements you're proud of since our last meeting?</li>
<li>What tasks have you found especially engaging or stimulating?</li>
<li>What do you think stands in the way of your progress?</li>
<li>What difficulties have you been facing recently?</li>
<li>What tasks do you find least engaging?</li>
<li>What kinds of projects are you interested in working on?</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Apply the <strong>Blake Mouton Model</strong> as a leader
<ol>
<li>Impoverished manager - low regard for creating systems, low regard for results</li>
<li>Produce-or-Perish Management - high regard for results, and team secondary to productivity</li>
<li>Middle-of-the-road Management - tries to balance results and team motivation. Through continual compromise this will fail to inspire high performance</li>
<li>Team Management - most effective management style. Passionate about his work and does the best for his/her people.
<img src="/images/blake-mouton.png" alt="BlakeMouton" /></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Apply the <strong>Path-Goal Theory</strong>
<ol>
<li>Helping them identify and achieve their goals.</li>
<li>Clearing away obstacles, thereby improving performance.</li>
<li>Offering appropriate rewards along the way.</li>
<li>Align path and goals with organizations principles and values.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
