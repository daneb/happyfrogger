<p>The road of life <br />
ah yes the road of life</p>
<p>At some turn along life, <br />
there THEY comes with their assault of strife <br />
with winds that rage and winds that blow, <br />
they beat, make meat of the courageous feat. <br />
To live is hard. Is it?</p>
<p>The weapons of these diabolical demons, <br />
are seldom understood or even from my hood. <br />
They beckon me come and surrender the fight. <br />
They beckon me come and surrender the night.</p>
<p>What of hopes and dreams and joy and streams, <br />
What of health and wealth, <br />
when it's all abated. <br />
They come with his assault of strife, <br />
attacking and sucking me into the darkness.</p>
<p>I fight, I kick, I whip, I punch, <br />
I raise my hand, but I get pulled in a bunch. <br />
They are strong, far stronger than me, <br />
They deep in my mind causing calamity. <br />
Turn back turn back the light onto me, <br />
Turn back turn back its uncomfortable inadequacy.</p>
<p>FIGHT! FIGHT! I say. I say. <br />
But the warmth of day is gone <br />
All around me has diminished, chaos around. Chaos. <br />
Hope what of it, I know it intellectually. <br />
But she is hidden. Where I don't know?</p>
<p>How did it get all so complex. <br />
How did THEY get so strong. <br />
Who are THEY and why do me wrong. <br />
My legs are deep in the myrrh now, DEEP. <br />
Darkness is upon me, and I can't intellectualize myself away</p>
<p>A crack from the heavens <br />
A fizzle? a ray? a sparkle? a way. <br />
Some spirit illuminates <br />
&quot;My grace is sufficient for thee: for my strength is made perfect in weakness.&quot;
HUH.</p>
<p>What did it mean? <br />
I began to tussle with the words of the spirit, <br />
I wrestle, turn, twist and contort, <br />
hammering against 14 challengers a new, <br />
looking for answers for this light so few.</p>
<p>And little did I notice, <br />
that as I wrestled with the 14 challengers that day, <br />
my contention with THEY went away, <br />
darkness still loomed in the distance, <br />
but the battle was over, for now.</p>
<p>I recited the words of the spirit, <br />
and then it hit me like a ton of bricks succinctly, <br />
That it was never about MY OWN *strength** to overcome <br />
But I was already equipped with *grace sufficient* to step out the darkness <br />
Despite my inherent weakness.</p>
<p>They will be back soon, one day, <br />
and in my weakness to these words I shall cling.</p>
